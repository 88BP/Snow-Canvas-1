# snowcanvas


Practicing snow in canvas. This version will have slowly falling circles instead of stylized flakes. I am able to change the size and number of flakes depending on what's preferred for the site. 

Here are a few more demos of different ways to stylize the snow: http://www.onextrapixel.com/examples/let-it-snow/index6.html
